        <p>2hollis is a rising artist known for his genre-defying music that blends elements of hip-hop, electronic dance music (EDM), techno, and more. Based in Los Angeles, 2hollis is both a performer and a music producer who takes full control over his creative process, from producing to mixing and recording his tracks. His music is characterized by a minimalist approach, utilizing negative space to keep listeners engaged, and has a unique, almost mystical quality. Tracks like "GOD," "PLASTER," and "FORFEIT" have gained attention, with some even featured on EA Sportsâ€™ F1 23 soundtrack.</p>
        
        <p>He has captivated audiences worldwide with high-energy performances, often involving mosh pits and fan interaction, despite his music sometimes having a more mellow, introspective feel. His latest single, "Jeans," continues his genre-blending exploration and adds to an impressive discography.</p>
